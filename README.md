Project Title: Learn to Build Real Time Power BI Snapdeal Project
Domain: Data Analytics
Executive Summary This project demonstrates the end-to-end data life cycle, from automated web scraping to executive-level visualization. The goal was to analyze 100+ e-commerce products from Snapdeal to understand pricing dynamics and consumer feedback.
Technical Tasks Performed Task 1 & 2 (Web Scraping): Built a Python script using Selenium to automatically extract product names, prices, discounts, and ratings across five categories (Accessories, Footwear, Kids Fashion, Men Clothing, and Women Clothing).
Task 3 (Data Structuring): Cleaned the raw data and saved it into a structured CSV format (snapdeal.task1.csv) for seamless integration with Power BI.
Task 4 (Correlation Analysis): Used Scatter Plots to analyze the relationship between discount percentages and customer ratings.
Task 5 (Trend Monitoring): Created visualizations to monitor average pricing and rating trends across different product sections.
Task 6 (Executive Dashboard): Designed a final dashboard summarizing critical KPIs: Average Price (₹375.28), Average Discount (37.50%), and Average Rating (3.48).
Business Insights Inventory Balance: The product distribution is perfectly balanced at 20% for each of the five categories analyzed.
Pricing Strategy: The average product price suggests a high-volume, budget-friendly market strategy.
Customer Satisfaction: While discounts are high (37.5%), the average rating (3.48) indicates a need for quality improvements to match the value proposition.
